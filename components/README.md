# Components

The shared UI vocabulary. Screens are assembled from these primitives, driven by
design tokens (`tokens.ts`) — edit a token and everything updates
(ARCHITECTURE.md §3). Keeping this inventory current is part of the Definition
of Done (`CLAUDE.md`).

## Inventory

**Brand**
- `brand/LoafBadge` — the Ciabatta loaf (SVG), the current-holder trophy motif.
- `brand/Wordmark` — "CIABATTA CUP" wordmark, `tone` light/dark.

**UI primitives**
- `ui/Button` — primary action button (green, 2px ink border, offset shadow).
- `ui/Field` — labelled input; `reveal` adds a password Show/Hide toggle.
- `ui/Chip` — selectable pill (2px ink border; fills green when selected). Used
  for the match type/format choices; reusable for any one-of-many selection.

**Auth**
- `auth/SignInForm` — email + password sign-in (client, `useActionState`).
- `auth/SignUpForm` — create-account (name + email + password).
- `auth/AcceptInviteForm` — invite-only password setup before profile
  activation (client, `useActionState`).

**Match**
- `match/LogMatchForm` — the log-match wizard (design screen 03): 3 steps
  (matchup → type & format → per-set scores), shared pure validation, submits via
  the `submitMatch` server action. Submission only — no confirm/approve/scoring.
- `match/ConfirmMatchButton` — opponent-side confirm (calls `confirmMatch`); the
  DB trigger advances the status once both players confirm.
- `match/ApprovalActions` — admin Approve / Query / Reject for a `pending_approval`
  match (calls the admin match actions).
- `match/RebuildRatingsButton` — admin recovery control that rebuilds ratings,
  history, and reign caches from immutable facts.

**Players (admin)**
- `players/InvitePlayerForm` — admin invite form (design screen 08): name + email
  → `inviteUser` server action (`useActionState`).
- `players/DeletePlayerButton` — confirmed admin hard-delete for unused players;
  the server refuses self-deletion and any player referenced by a match.
- `players/PlayerAvatar` — Supabase Storage avatar with deterministic initials
  fallback; used by leaderboard and profiles.
- `players/ReignSummary` — hydrated current-holder duration and reign count.

Planned next (from ARCHITECTURE.md): `Card`, `RankBadge`, `StatBlock`.
